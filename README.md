# tryouts
a catch-all repo for trying out new things. 

## Have at it
this code comes with no guarentees or implied support, it's just my own bucket for random tech R&D.

## What you can rely on
- commits will mention what's working and especially when things aren't fully working.
- each folder's it's own app
- `working` branch is where i put stuff when i've reach a satifactory milestone. `dev` branch is exactly that.

## reach out
feel free to comment, PR, add issues.
